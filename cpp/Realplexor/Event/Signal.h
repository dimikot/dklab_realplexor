//@ ATTENTION: Java-style C++ programming below. :-)
//@
//@ This is a line-by-line C++ rewrite of Perl prototype code with obvious speed
//@ optimizations (like avoiding excess copies, config pre-parsing etc.).
//@
//@ The code is so compact (2600 lines) and so simple, that I decided not to
//@ split it into *.hpp & *.cpp files nor create Makefiles, but place
//@ everything into included *.h files (like Perl, Java, C# and most of other
//@ languages do). It is not quite common for C++, but it surely simple
//@ when a program is small (especially when it is rewritten line by line
//@ from another language).
//@
//@ Also the code has global variables within the top namespace: one variable
//@ per Storage and one CONFIG, they are like singletons.
